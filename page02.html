      <h3 class="subTitle">When your disease is hard to name and doesn’t have visible symptoms, it can be hard for others to understand that you are sick. And, when people don’t know much about your disease, it can be hard to explain it to family and friends.This sentiment is particularly true for the some <span class = "id">50 million people</span> in the United States living with autoimmune diseases.</h3>

      <p><span class = "id">Autoimmune Disease </span> happens when the body’s natural defense system can’t tell the difference between your own cells and foreign cells, causing the body to mistakenly attack normal cells. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases that affect a wide range of body parts.</p>
